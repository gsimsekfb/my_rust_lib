// dst: Dynamically sized types aka DSTs or unsized types these types let us 
// write code using values whose size we can know only at runtime

#[test] fn ex() {
    // Problem
    // let s1: str = "Hello there!";    // 12 bytes
    // let s2: str = "How's it going?"; // 15 bytes
        // Error: Rust needs to know how much memory to allocate for any 
        // value of a particular type, 
        // and ALL values of a type must use the SAME amount of memory.
        // error[E0277]: the size for values of type `str` cannot be known at
        // compilation time

    // Sol: use &str instead of str
    let s1: &str = "Hello there!";    // Size: 16 (2 usize, ptr + len)
    let s2: &str = "How's it going?"; // Size: 16 (2 usize, ptr + len)
    assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<&str>(), 16); // size of &str   
    assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<&i32>(),  8); // size of &T
}

// So although a &T is a single value that stores the memory address of 
// where the T is located, &str is two values: the addr of the str and its length. 
// As such, we can know the size of a &str value at compile time: 
// itâ€™s twice the length of a usize
// That is, we always know the size of a &str
// In general, this is the way in which dynamically sized types are used in Rust:
// they have an extra bit of metadata that stores the size of the dynamic info.
// The golden rule of dynamically sized types is that we must always put values
// of dynamically sized types behind a pointer of some kind.
// Every trait is a dynamically sized type.

/* 
Step-by-Step Execution:

1. Initialization:

- The loop starts a new iteration.
- tokio::select! evaluates all futures (f1() and f2()) and begins polling them concurrently.

2. Polling:

- Both f1() and f2() are started simultaneously (they are "spawned" as async tasks under the hood).
- The select! macro waits for whichever future completes first.

3. Completion:

a) If f1() completes first:
    The x = f1() branch is taken.
    The result is bound to x.
    println!("Operation 1 completed first with: {}", x) executes.
    The other future (f2()) is dropped (its work is discarded).

b) If f2() completes first:
    The y = f2() branch is taken.
    The result is bound to y.
    println!("Operation 2 completed first with: {}", y) executes.
    The other future (f1()) is dropped.

4. Next Iteration:

The loop restarts, and select! runs again, re-evaluating f1() and f2() from scratch (since they were dropped after the previous iteration).
